# Simple Captcha Solver

## Summary

A minimal web application demonstrating a basic captcha solver.  It generates a random string of characters displayed as an image, and the user must input the correct string to verify.

**Note:** This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. A real-world captcha solver would require a more robust image generation and verification system to prevent automated bots from solving it.

## Setup

1.  Create a new directory for the project.
2.  Save the `index.html`, `main.js`, and `style.css` files into the directory.

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2.  A captcha image will be displayed.
3.  Enter the text from the image into the input field.
4.  Click the "Verify" button.
5.  The result will be displayed below the button.
