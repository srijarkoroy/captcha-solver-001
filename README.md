# Simple Captcha Solver

## Summary

This is a minimal web application that demonstrates a basic captcha solver interface.  It includes an image display, an input field for the user to enter the captcha, and a submit button.  **Note:** The image generation and validation are placeholders. This code requires backend and ML image recognition to be fully functional.

## Setup

1.  Save the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files to a directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  The captcha image will be displayed.
2.  Enter the text you see in the image into the input field.
3.  Click the "Submit" button.
4.  A message will appear indicating whether your answer was correct or incorrect.
