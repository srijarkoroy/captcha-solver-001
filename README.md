# Simple Captcha Solver

## Summary

A basic web application that displays a captcha image and allows the user to input the corresponding text. It then verifies the input against the actual captcha text.

## Setup

1.  Save the contents of `index.html`, `main.js`, and `style.css` into their respective files.
2.  Ensure all files are in the same directory.

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2.  A captcha image will be displayed.
3.  Enter the text displayed in the captcha image into the input field.
4.  Click the "Submit" button.
5.  A message will appear indicating whether the captcha was matched or mismatched.

**Note:** This is a simplified example. In a real-world application, captcha images and text should be generated server-side to prevent bots from easily bypassing the system.
