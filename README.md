# Simple Captcha Solver

## Summary

This is a minimal web application that provides a basic Captcha solving interface.  **Note:** The captcha solving logic is currently a placeholder and would need to be replaced with an actual implementation (e.g., an API call to a captcha solving service or a machine learning model).

## Setup

1.  Save the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` files in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  A Captcha image will be displayed (currently a static image).
2.  Enter the text you see in the image into the input field.
3.  Click the "Submit" button.
4.  A message will indicate whether the Captcha was solved correctly. The current example only solves for "ABCD".
